# Headings: 

You can have headings using the hastags (more hastags mean a smaller font / organization)

## Code chunks

You can include code chunks like these below (note that you can use `echo` to include or exclude the code). See that this chunk is called 'naming-chunk' 
```{r naming-chunk, echo = FALSE}
hist(iris$Sepal.Length)
```

## Learning more

To learn more about R and your options, you can look at this [RMarkdown guide](https://zsmith27.github.io/rmarkdown_crash-course/lesson-2-rmd-creation.html).


### Notes
You can test out what the 'pretty' version of the file would look like by changing output to have this instead of md_document (and following lines (ignore the `r' portion`))

```{r yaml-example-code, eval = FALSE}
output:
  html_document:
    toc: false
    theme: united
    
```
