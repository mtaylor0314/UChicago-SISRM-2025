# Headings:

You can have headings using the hastags (more hastags mean a smaller
font / organization)

## Code chunks

You can include code chunks like these below (note that you can use
`echo` to include or exclude the code). See that this chunk is called
‘naming-chunk’ ![](README_files/figure-gfm/naming-chunk-1.png)<!-- -->

## Learning more

To learn more about R and your options, you can look at this [RMarkdown
guide](https://zsmith27.github.io/rmarkdown_crash-course/lesson-2-rmd-creation.html).

### Notes

You can test out what the ‘pretty’ version of the file would look like
by changing output to have this instead of md_document (and following
lines (ignore the `r' portion`))

``` r
output:
  html_document:
    toc: false
    theme: united
```
